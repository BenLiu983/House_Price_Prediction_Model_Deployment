# House Price Prediction Model Development and Deployment


# Introduction

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses. 
Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments, or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or under-estimated.

# Metrics

The metrics to evaluate model performance would be the mean squared error (mse), the root squared of the mean squared error (rmse), and r square.

# Section 1 Model Development

1.1 Exploratroy Data Analysis (EDA)

The house price dataset contains 1460 rows, i.e., houses, and 81 columns, i.e., variables.

**Analyse the dataset to identify:**

1. Missing values
2. Numerical variables
3. Distribution of the numerical variables
4. Outliers
5. Categorical variables
6. Cardinality of the categorical variables
7. Potential relationship between the variables and the target: SalePrice
